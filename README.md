Repository for code from my 2019-Jan-27 blog post:

### [System Tray Icons with WPF in the .NET Core 3.0 Preview](https://mcguirev10.com/2019/01/27/system-tray-icons-wpf-net-core-preview.html)

---
This is a .NET Core 3.0 port of Philipp Sumi's [WPF NotifyIcon](http://www.hardcodet.net/wpf-notifyicon) library.
The port effort was a matter of project setup details only. All of Philipp's in-code copyrights remain intact.
